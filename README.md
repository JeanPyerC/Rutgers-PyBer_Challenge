# Rutgers- PyBer Challenge

## Overview of the analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this project is to pull csv files and to combine them, merging them into a new dataframe. Not only that, is to create a specific data by grouping certain characters and creating a task. The task could be summing, division, multiplication, it can be anything. Once we obtain the value, the next step is to create a graph for a better visual purpose. It's great to pull data, able to create a graph for a beter presentation is amazing! 

## Results

 **1. I was able to get the total number of rides for each city type.**  
  - Focusing the Merge Data Frame. 
  - By grouping the type under header "type" and counting the id under header "ride_id", we got the following results.
    
**2. I was able to get the total number of drivers for each city type.**  
  - Focusing on the City Data Frame.
  - By grouping the type under header "type" and adding the numeric value under header "driver count". 
   
**3. I was able to get the sum of the fares for each city type.**  
  - Focusing on the Merge Data Frame.  
  - By grouping the type under header "type" and adding the numeric value under header "fare".
    
**4. I was able to get the average fare per ride for each city type.**  
  - Focusing on the Merge Data Frame.
  - By grouping the type under header "type" and using the mean ot find the average under header "fare".
 
**5. I was able to find the average fare per driver for each city.**  
  - By taking the values we already created such as "Total Fare" and "Total Drivers".
  - Both values were divded and the amount was showing by the city type. 
    
**6. I created a new DataFrame by summarzing the data I created and formatting it.**  
  - Nothing was added or changed, I just created a new dataframe by using the value I created.
    
    
## Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By focusing on the graph listed below, you can see a large difference between the Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, a *Rural Area* is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. They have low number of population, low number of employments, and the number of drivers and request of drivers are low causing the total value to be low. Personaly speaking, don't focus to much on this area as numbers will also be low within this area. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A *Suburb Area* is a commercial, mixed-use or residential area. These areas have a large number of people, with a large number of homes. People will defintly use transportaion when they have to go somewhere. Good source of income, however, people living in the Suburb Area are most likely finicailly established with their own transportation. I will definilty focus on this area as it does bring more income compared against the Rural Area. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An *Urban Area* is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. This area will contain a large number of people, large number of business area, this is a high priority. A great example will be like New York City. No one drives in the big city as the value of parking is to high, traffic is terrible, and to find parking is really difficult. Not only that, there are more visiors due when traveling for business. Focus on these areas on the most.
