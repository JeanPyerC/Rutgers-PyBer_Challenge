# Rutgers- PyBer Challenge

## Overview of the analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this project is to pull csv files and to combine them, merging them into a new dataframe. Not only that, is to create a specific data by grouping certain characters and creating a task. The task could be summing, division, multiplication, it can be anything. Once we obtain the value, the next step is to create a graph for a better visual purpose. It's great to pull data, able to create a graph for a beter presentation is amazing!
